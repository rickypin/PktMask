# PktMask Refactoring Roadmap - Context7 Implementation Plan

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Planning Date**: 2025-01-24  
**Implementation Timeline**: 4-6 weeks  
**Risk Level**: P0 (Critical architectural improvements)

## Executive Summary

This roadmap provides a phased approach to address critical architectural issues identified in the PktMask codebase analysis. The plan prioritizes high-impact improvements while maintaining 100% GUI compatibility and functional integrity.

### Key Objectives
1. **Simplify GUI Architecture**: Reduce 6 managers to 3 components (50% complexity reduction)
2. **Standardize Naming**: Implement consistent conventions across codebase
3. **Remove Technical Debt**: Clean up deprecated code and legacy patterns
4. **Optimize Performance**: Reduce manager coordination overhead from 15-20% to <5%

## Phase 1: GUI Manager Simplification (P0 Critical)

### 1.1 Timeline: Weeks 1-3

**Objective**: Replace over-complex 6-manager system with simplified 3-component architecture

### 1.2 Current State Analysis

**Existing Managers (To Be Replaced):**
```python
# From src/pktmask/gui/main_window.py
UIManager          # UI initialization & theming
FileManager        # File selection & path management  
PipelineManager    # Processing control & thread management
ReportManager      # Report generation & statistics display
DialogManager      # Dialog creation & user interaction
EventCoordinator   # Inter-manager events & state sync
```

**Problems Identified:**
- Complex inter-manager dependencies
- 200+ lines of coordination code
- Difficult debugging across multiple components
- Performance overhead from event coordination

### 1.3 Proposed 3-Component Architecture

**New Components Design:**

```python
class AppController:
    """Business Logic & Processing Control
    
    Responsibilities:
    - Pipeline execution coordination
    - Service layer integration
    - Processing state management
    - Error handling & recovery
    """
    
class UIBuilder:
    """Interface Construction & Event Handling
    
    Responsibilities:
    - UI component initialization
    - Theme management & styling
    - User event handling
    - File selection dialogs
    """
    
class DataService:
    """State Management & Reporting
    
    Responsibilities:
    - Statistics tracking & display
    - Report generation & formatting
    - Progress monitoring
    - Data persistence
    """
```

### 1.4 Implementation Steps

**Week 1: Design & Foundation**
1. Create new component interfaces
2. Design data flow between components
3. Plan migration strategy for existing functionality
4. Set up unit tests for new components

**Week 2: Core Implementation**
1. Implement AppController with service integration
2. Implement UIBuilder with Qt interface management
3. Implement DataService with statistics handling
4. Migrate critical functionality from existing managers

**Week 3: Integration & Testing**
1. Integrate new components with MainWindow
2. Remove old manager dependencies
3. Comprehensive testing to ensure GUI compatibility
4. Performance validation and optimization

### 1.5 Success Metrics

**Code Quality:**
- MainWindow lines: 1,013 → <500 (50% reduction)
- Manager count: 6 → 3 (50% reduction)
- Coordination code: 200+ lines → <50 lines (75% reduction)

**Performance:**
- Manager overhead: 15-20% → <5% (70% improvement)
- Memory usage: 30% reduction from fewer objects
- Startup time: 10% improvement

## Phase 2: Naming Standardization & Legacy Cleanup (P1 High)

### 2.1 Timeline: Week 4

**Objective**: Implement consistent naming conventions and remove technical debt

### 2.2 Naming Standardization Plan

**Current Inconsistencies:**
| Context | Current Patterns | Standardized Target |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| GUI Display | "Remove Dupes", "Anonymize IPs", "Mask Payloads" | Keep current (user-facing) |
| Code Variables | `enable_dedup`, `enable_anon`, `enable_mask` | `remove_dupes`, `anonymize_ips`, `mask_payloads` |
| Stage Classes | `DeduplicationStage`, `UnifiedIPAnonymizationStage` | `DeduplicationStage`, `AnonymizationStage`, `MaskingStage` |
| Config Keys | Mixed patterns | `remove_dupes`, `anonymize_ips`, `mask_payloads` |

**Implementation Tasks:**
1. Update all code variables to use standardized names
2. Rename stage classes for consistency
3. Update configuration keys and mappings
4. Update CLI argument parsing
5. Update documentation and comments

### 2.3 Legacy Code Cleanup

**Items for Removal:**
```python
# Deprecated classes (74 lines)
class PipelineThread(QThread):  # Replace with ServicePipelineThread

# Mixed language comments
def _init_managers(self):
    """初始化所有管理器"""  # Convert to English

# Unused imports and dead code paths
# Legacy stage implementations
```

**Cleanup Tasks:**
1. Remove PipelineThread class and references
2. Convert Chinese comments to English
3. Remove unused import statements
4. Clean up dead code paths
5. Update documentation language consistency

### 2.4 Expected Outcomes

**Code Quality:**
- Remove 200+ lines of dead code
- Achieve 100% English documentation
- Eliminate deprecated code paths
- Improve code clarity and maintainability

## Phase 3: Service Layer Optimization (P2 Medium)
